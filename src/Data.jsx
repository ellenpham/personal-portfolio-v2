      "I am Ellen Pham - a junior full-stack developer, based in Melbourne, Australia. I am a coder by heart, and my experience in business setting have equipped me with valuable skills to be adaptable to any work environment. Since I was young, I has always been fascinated about how technology has evolved and how amazing web applications were created to serve us in daily life. I want to be a part of the tech industry, contributing to create real programs that solve real-world problems. Soon to be a graduate from Coder Academy, I strive to expand my tech knowledge and sharpen my coding skills. I always put in 100% effort in my study and work.

    description: 'Back in 2017, I worked in marketing data management team at Bosch, Singapore. In 2019, I moved back to Australia and worked as a resourcing specialist at Programmed Skilled Workforce. Throughout my career, I have operated on various company internal systems, and have always been the go-to person when it comes to system operation. My passion for technology and the confidence working with systems gradually grew throughout years of performing database management. Yet, I still found the job was not challenging enough. I then took my courage and leapt into the newfound passion - coding. I love combining the worlds of logic and creative design to make engaging, functional, and accessible websites and applications. My aim is to deliver meaningful storytelling through exceptional digital experience.',

    description: "The four values that I am always upholding: Integrity - Trust - Dedication - Humbleness. And my favourite quote from Maya Angelou 'Do the best you can until you know better. Then when you know better, do better'. Switching to tech career is not easy but I believe that if you put your heart in whatever you do, work hard and never give up, you will get rewarded with fruitful outcome.",

    description: "Me, when I am not coding, I am a dedicated mum of an active 3-year-old girl, who has taught me a lot about empathy, positivity, resilience, time management and creative thinking. I am also a yoga lover, a plants addict, an aspiring chef, and a spiritual enthusiast. I am mindful in everything I do and find my happiness in the giving's. That also makes me a team-oriented person, in both personal life and work environment, I communicate and collaborate with others with dedication and respect. I keep a beginner's mindset when it comes to reaching out for assistance and clarifying my questions. By myself, I learn and work diligently to support everyone around me in achieving common goals.",
